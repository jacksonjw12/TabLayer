OK, hi
Im thinking this should be a game where you have to build a base with your friends, or a random team, and you will have x mins to build, and then you have to survive the onslot
During the battle, you can man a battlestation you have created. The base should be pokemon/undertale styled architectur, with rymdkaspel styled collection of materials
Maybe you can build multiple forts and once maybe a pvp mode where you can build your own robot//skeleton attackers and have a battle, but you can never leave your base.

You can unlock better tower armor plates and more floors.
Upper floors will have to be scaled to, or will eed to be attacked by air things.
be cool to see how it kinda works
